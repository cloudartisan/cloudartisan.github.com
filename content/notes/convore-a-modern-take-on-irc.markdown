    [Convore.com](http://convore.com) is latest entry in the realm of web based chat systems. While there are many others(Campfire, StackOverflow Chat, TinyChat etc.), Convore really is the first chat service that hits the sweet spot between [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat "Internet Relay Chat") and web based chat service.

[Convore.com](http://convore.com) is latest entry in the realm of web based chat systems. While there are many others(Campfire, StackOverflow Chat, TinyChat etc.), Convore really is the first chat service that hits the sweet spot between [IRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat "Internet Relay Chat") and web based chat service. 


Convore allows anyone to set up chat groups instantly, but unlike others, _**free of cost**_. Even the private groups are free. Add to it a pretty and usable user interface even your technology resistant mom can figure out and you have a near perfect IRC replacement(for your non-geek amigos, at least).

### Topics work like they should(unlike IRC)

Anyone who has spent some time on the FOSS IRC channels knows that when people decide to discuss on a particular topic, one has to wait for the current discussion to finish before proposing/starting the discussion on a different topic. Failing to do so is considered rude and could result in a kick out by admins. Worry no more. On Convore, topics are mutually exclusive, which means there can be any number of active topics at one time.

I am really enjoying Convore. We even started using it as [our office](http://ikraftsoft.com) collaboration tool - bye bye Skype, GTalk. 

Thank you Convore and [team](https://convore.com/about/) for a superb product; I wish you best of luck.
