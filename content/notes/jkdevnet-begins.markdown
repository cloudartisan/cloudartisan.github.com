    Long over due, Jammu and Kashmir Developer Network begins life.
...

After repeated(failed) attempts at starting a local developer community here in Kashmir(Barcamp Kashmir, FOSSKashmir, etc.), we are trying to boot a new developer network in Jammu and Kashmir. As a direct result of [G|Kashmir][gkashmir] event, a lot of people seem to be interested interested in the idea. Thank you Google. 

It started with [Zaid][zaidweb] calling me, [Yasser Kazmi][myasa] and [Owais Lone][olone] about starting a [Google Technology User Group][gtug] in Kashmir. One thing led to another and we decided to start a generic developer network, named **JKDevNet**, as an umbrella community for all the other focused user groups. 

## So, what is JKDevNet all about?

 - **STICTLY** informal community of developers, designers, programmers and eventually for the users of technology as well.
 - It's for everyone; anyone can join.
 - There are no rules, except one: Be Nice. 
 - No masters; No leaders; No followers. Only peers.
 - No spectators allowed. Only Participators.
 - There will not be any Facebook group. IRC and mailing lists only. May be a website in future.
 - First meetup will be soon - very soon. Extent of the meetup will depends on how many people actually start participating.


All we have right now is a mailing list and an IRC room. There may or may not be a website. Since target is to foster a community built around communication; a website is a very low priority right now.

### Mailing List

Mailing list is hosted on [LibreList][librelist].

To subscribe, send a blank email to `jkdevnet@librelist.com` and you will receive the instructions on how to proceed further.

### IRC

JKDevNet IRC channel is `#jkdevnet` on `irc.oftc.net`. 

You can use any IRC client to connect to OFTC. If you don't have one yet, pick one from the list: 

 - [X-Chat][xchat] for Linux  
 - [Smuxi][smuxi] for Windows, Linux  
 - [mIRC][mirc] for Windows  
 - [colloquy][colloquy] for OS X  

*See you there.*
