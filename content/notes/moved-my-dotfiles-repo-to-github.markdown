    Finally, I gave in and moved my Vim, bash and other dotfiles from [Hg](http://bitbucket.org/)/[bitbucket](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) to [git](http://git-scm.com/)/[github](http://github.com). The repository is available at [http://github.com/mnazim/dotfiles](http://github.com/mnazim/dotfiles) . GitHub is awesome, just found out git is not that bad either.

I have been resisting using [git](http://git-scm.com/)(and consequently [github](http://github.com/mnazim/dotfiles))for quite some time now. My main reason for not using git was horrible UX which I could not get my head around(which to some extent is still a problem). I finally gave in and started learning git anyway. I still get confused a lot, but slowly things are starting to make sense. 

Two features won me over immediately: 

1. Ability to commit modified files selectively.
2. Submodules. Simply wonderful.

Like any self-respecting hacker, I version control my dotfiles and was the first thing that I moved to git. Now my dofiles live at [github.com/mnazim/dotfiles](http://github.com/mnazim/dotfiles). Feel free to fork and hack.

Someone asked me why I moved away from Hg. I do not have anything against [Hg](http://mercurial.selenic.com/). It is a wonderful and perfectly capable version control system. We use it at [work](http://ikraftsofte.com) to manage all our project and it serves us very well. We do not plan to move away from it. Therefore, it's safe to say I did not move away from Hg, I moved away from [bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org). Even with the features like free private repositories and  more disk space(which github lacks), github is a far superior tool. Usablity wise bitbucket has been left far far behind and it is yet to be seen how [Altasian](http://blog.bitbucket.org/2010/09/29/bitbucket-joins-atlassian/) will improve bitbucket and turn it into a "money bucket".

All said, both git and Hg are great tools. Choose what ever fits your brain. Also checkout [HgInit.com](http://hginit.com), a great Hg tutorial by [Joel Spolsky](http://joelonsoftware.com)
