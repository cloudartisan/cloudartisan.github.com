<h1>Auditing Cloud Service Providers</h1>

  <h2>What's Up?</h2>

<p>I want to find existing documented best practice processes and questionnaires for auditing cloud service providers.</p>

<p>I was hoping to find existing surveys/questionnaires that can be reused to perform audits on cloud service providers. I was also hoping those audits could be performed without introducing much additional load for the auditor or the cloud service providers. <em>Especially</em> for the auditor... because, no doubt, that will be me.</p>

<p>Let's face it, no one enjoys an auditing. No cloud service provider thinks <em>"Oh, goody, another small prospect that wants me to respond to yet-another- time-consuming audit!"</em> And I certainly do not want to write a lengthy document of intrusive questions about services I'm already using.</p>

<h2>Early Research</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, so far I've found that cloud computing hasn't reached that stage... yet.</p>

<p>I came across articles on how standardised surveys/questionnaires do not exist, how the myriad different audit efforts are stifling cloud service providers, bogging them down, inhibiting innovation. Here are a couple of examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://cloudsecurity.org/blog/2009/06/16/stop-the-madness-cloud-onboarding-audits-an-open-question.html">Stop the Madness! Cloud Onboarding Audits - An Open Question</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.rationalsurvivability.com/blog/?p=877">Incomplete Thought: The Crushing Costs of Complying With Cloud Customer “Right To Audit” Clauses</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Those articles make for a very good read (<em>wait</em>, don't do that, stay here, keep reading). Those articles were a realistic slap in the face that brought me down to earth. No one was going to solve this for me.</p>

<p>But, those articles were approximately one year old. A lot can happen in one year, especially in cloud computing. Perhaps I would find a flicker of light at the end of the tunnel...</p>

<p>I then came across some promising initiatives. <em>Happy days!</em></p>

<h2>Cloud Security Alliance</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/About.html">Cloud Security Alliance</a> are a non-profit organisation that document issues, best practices, and guides for cloud security. They have some very handy <a href="http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/Research.html">research</a>. The most relevant appears to be their <a href="http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/guidance.html">Security Guidance</a> document and their <a href="http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/cm.html">Controls Matrix</a> spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Be warned: <em>the CSA's Security Guidance document definitely does not make for light reading!</em></p>

<p>After reading it I realised there was more to consider than I originally thought I needed to consider. Unfortunately, that left me with the strange sense that I had somehow taken a step backward, albeit a much more enlightened, informed step backward.</p>

<p>The CSA's Security Guidance document was clearly aimed at me (and a bunch of other people that I'm hoping will read my blog). At the end, though, I wasn't sure where to tread next.</p>

<p>I took a look at their Controls Matrix spreadsheet. <em>Ooh, a questionnaire!</em> 100 rows. 13 columns. I spotted PCI DSS and ISO 27002 and got very excited!  <em>This was more like it!</em></p>

<p>My only concern...</p>

<p>Is any cloud service provider going to take the time to respond to a prospect that shoves this hefty questionnaire under their nose? Surely the large guys wouldn't care? Surely the small guys are so busy innovating and evolving they wouldn't dare pin down a staff member to fill it out? Perhaps someone else, someone bigger, someone with more clout has already questioned cloud service providers and collated the results?</p>

<p>I went back to the CSA's research page. Bottom-left corner.  <a href="http://cloudaudit.org/">CloudAudit</a>. Promising name.</p>

<h2>Cloud Audit (A6)</h2>

<p>The blurb for <a href="http://cloudaudit.org/">CloudAudit</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The goal [...] is to [...] automate the Audit, Assertion, Assessment, and Assurance (A6) of their infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application (SaaS) environments</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nice. Promising.</p>

<p>CloudAudit appears to be relatively young. It was started in January 2010.</p>

<p>The site is light on content at the moment. Based on their <a href="http://cloudaudit.org/page3/page3.html">about page</a>, their <a href="http://cloudaudit.org/page4/page4.html">FAQ</a>, and their <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cloudaudit">Google Group</a> it seems like they're at the stage of being a working group, "ratifying namespaces", and contributing to the CSA's Compliance Controls Matrix (see above).</p>

<p>I did notice that the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cloudaudit/browse_thread/thread/a82bd2ff785aab67">latest post</a> in the Google Group mentions that they are getting ready to announce their "assembled v1.0 package". I'm not sure what that is, but it sounds good!</p>

<p>My guess is that this namespace ("which essentially looks like a directory structure") might be something like an LDAP directory that refers to relevant PCI DSS, NIST, COBIT, etc compliance. So a cloud service provider might have attributes that refer to DSNs in PCI DSS and ISO 27002 but not in NIST 800-53.  If that turns out to be the case and the "assembled v1.0 package" is a first cut of that structure, I assume it will then need to be populated with data, and then someone will need to mine that data to turn it into information.</p>

<p>Yes, it sounds promising, but it also sounds a bit further into the future than I can wait right now.</p>

<h2>Summary... for now</h2>

<p>So far my research paints the following picture:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>everyone is eager to audit their cloud service providers (more so than ye olde data centres)</p></li>
<li><p>there isn't (yet) an industry accepted standard for this</p></li>
<li><p>the large cloud service providers are going nuts with certification</p></li>
<li><p>the small guys are reusing the services of the large guys, citing their certifications, and claiming kudos by association</p></li>
<li><p>CloudAudit might be the beginning of the answer...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I can't leave it at that. <em>I don't want to be the guy who has to write these damn questionnaires!</em> So I've sent off some e-mail queries and will hopefully follow up with some awesome news in a future post.</p>

<p>Stay tuned...</p>
