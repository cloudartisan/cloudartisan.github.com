<h1>Auto-Scaling Is Avoidable, Potentially Dangerous... But Fun</h1>

<div class="body">
  <p>RightScale have some tutorials on using their service to set up auto-scaling.  Recently I played around with it, configuring auto-scaling in response to increases and decreases in server load. Honestly, it was fun. But it was essentially a folly, an exercise in dealing unnecessarily with dangerous corner cases.</p>

<p>Here's why...</p>

<h2>Unconstrained Scaling</h2>

<p>Unconstrained scaling is bad, mmkay. If you allow your systems to scale without constraint, you're risking a surprise credit card bill. Worse yet, if you're not paying any attention to your systems (shame!) then you could be in for a <em>jaw-dropping</em> credit card bill.</p>

<p>Launching 20 on-demand <code>m1.small</code> Linux instances for a month will set you back approximately $1,200 USD. That, of course, is assuming they run continuously after launch. It gets <em>worse</em> if you're launching them multiple times per hour.</p>

<p>Imagine your load is fluctuating up and down (or you've simply picked very poor thresholds to auto-scale). So let's say you're automatically launching and terminating instances several times per hour... let's say 3 times per hour... that's now $3,600.</p>

<p>Now, let's imagine half of those are <code>m2.2xlarge</code> Linux instances. We're now talking approximately $9,250.</p>

<p>Note, none of these rough calculations have taken traffic into account, or EBS usage, or S3 usage, or other sundry costs. And I'm not even going to do the maths for <code>m2.4xlarge</code> Windows instances!</p>

<h2>What About My ROI?</h2>

<p>You might say, <em>So what? Doesn't that mean I have more customers? Doesn't that mean I have more income?</em></p>

<p>Probably not. I doubt you have a direct correlation between demand and income.  I also doubt your charging is streamlined enough to protect your wallet.  Especially if you're a small, bootstrapped startup. Try explaining to your partner that some crazy ephemeral stuff happened somewhere on the Internet and now you can't afford the mortgage payment.</p>

<p>If you do manage to directly tie your income to server load...  congratulations! If you do manage to charge customers up-front for that server load before Amazon bills you... double congratulations! If you also have no bugs and will never ever <em>ever</em> suffer a denial of service attack... I will bear your man-babies!</p>

<h2>Isn't Cloud All About Auto-Scaling?</h2>

<p>No. It's about delivering compute power as a utility. You use what you need.  You use it when you need it. You pay for what you use. Like electricity.</p>

<h2>How Do I Cope With Demand?</h2>

<p>Plan. Prepare. Monitor. React.</p>

<p>You need monitoring.</p>

<p>You need to know your trends.</p>

<p>You need to know what the business is doing.</p>

<p>If you have a product launch, a new ad, a new article, a new pricing plan, an election, seasonal load, etc and you expect increased demand, simply launch additional instances to cope. After you've weathered the storm, terminate them.</p>

<p>For the moments you can't predict, allow for a small amount of auto-scaling, with heavily-tested constraints and monitoring to alert you <em>before</em> it starts. The limited auto-scaling covers for your response time. The monitoring alerts get you involved early on so you can make the call whether to launch additional servers or not.</p>

<h2>What About Those RightScale Tutorials?</h2>

<p>Note, RightScale makes no mention of the risks of auto-scaling in their documentation. I think they should. I wonder if they've had any support requests along the lines of <em>"I followed your tutorials, scaled, and now I have to sell my car. Is this covered by your SLA?"</em></p>

<p>Knowing what you know now, check out the main tutorial: <a href="http://support.rightscale.com/03-Tutorials/02-AWS/02-Website_Edition/How_do_I_set_up_Autoscaling%3f">How do I set up Autoscaling?</a> It has links to all the necessary bits and bobs.</p>

<h2>And The Fun Stuff?</h2>

<p>Here's a screenshot showing RightScale automatically launching web servers to cope with increased demand.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot showing one of my HAProxy load balancers backed by auto-scaled web servers.</p>

<p>Now, go have some responsible, careful, constrained fun of your own!</p>

<p><em>* Currently, a single on-demand m1.small Linux instance costs roughly $0.085 USD per hour</em></p>

<p><em>** Currently, a single on-demand m2.2xlarge Linux instance costs roughly $1.20 USD per hour</em></p>
